## Overview

For this option you are going to write a simple blogging engine. Your version will need to support
the following features:

- A home page that will display all the current blog entries
- A page that allows a user to create a new blog entry
- A page that allows a user to edit an existing blog entry
- A page method to delete blog posts
- You will need 4 separate pages (Home, new, edit, delete)
- Store your blog entries in a database
- (optional) Implement authentication

## Navigation

Each page will have consistent navigation. It will have a be vertical navigation bar similar to how
the course webpage is setup. This should make it easy for the user to know where they are. 

## Style

We are going to write our own style sheet that will have at least 10 CSS rules to make our site
look fancy!  

## Persistence

We will leverage the free Heroku Postgres Starter Tier dev database for our app.

## Frameworks

This project will not use any front end frameworks, everything will be built from scratch.

## Checkpoint 1 - Continuous Integration

We will setup a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to build, test, and deploy
the code to Heroku on each commit. 

## Checkpoint 2 - Define basic templates

On this checkpoint we will have our base templates defined and hard coded data to display them.

## Checkpoint 3 - Define database schema 

At this checkpoint our app will display a list of 5 blog posts (readonly) that are just hard coded
into the app.

## Checkpoint 4 - Add database

At this checkpoint our app will display a list of 5 blog posts (readonly) that are loaded from a
database.


## Checkpoint 5 - New/Edit/Update Features

At this checkpoint our app will allow you to create a new blog post and edit and update existing
blog posts.

## Checkpoint 6 - Final Polishing

At this checkpoint we will do end to end testing and front end UI polishing.
