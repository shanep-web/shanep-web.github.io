## Overview

The number #1 reason for students failing this course is falling behind. In this class I have
released 100% of the schedule on day 1 so you can know what is coming due at any point in the
semester.  To that end we are going to do a quick scavenger hunt. This will probably be the easiest
scavenger hunt in history as I will tell you exactly where to look and what to do. The purpose of
this lab is to ensure that you are aware of when everything is due, familiarize yourself with the
course, and make sure you have all the development tools installed and ready to use.

## Task 1 - Install VSCode

In this task we will get all of our development tools setup on our machine. If you have a computer
that is not capable of installing all the required tools you will need to complete your homework in
the department provided computer lab. While you are free to use whatever IDE or editor you want the
only supported editor is VSCode.

- Install the VScode [Coding pack for Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/installers)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Task 2 - Install Git

You will also need to install git so it is available on the command line if necessary. Git can be
download from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/). If you are on windows make sure and install the
**64-bit Git for Windows Setup** version. Keep all the setting default unless you **really** know
what your doing.

## Task 3 - Install Node.js

We will be using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) extensively this semester so you will need
to install it on your local machine. Once you have Node.js installed you can run the hello.js file
to ensure that everything is working.

```bash
$ node hello.js
Hello World
```

## Task 4 - Scavenger hunt

Open the file **ScavengerHunt.md** and complete all the TODO items that are listed.

## Task 5 - Add, Commit, Push your code

Once you are finished you need to make sure that you have pushed all your code to GitHub for grading!

## Extra Help

In order to run node from the command line use the following steps:

- Open up a terminal

  - [How to open a terminal on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install)
- Change to the directory where you cloned the starter repo.
  - `cd /path/to/your/repo`
- Run node!
