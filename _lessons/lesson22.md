## Overview

The textbook introduces node.js and express. In order to get prepared for your
final project in this lab you will use the [express application
generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) to quickly generate
a "hello world" application. Once you have your application generated you can
add database support using any supported database. [Integration
instructions](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html) are
located on the express website.

You are allowed to **copy/paste** code examples from the express site. It is not
plagiarism to use the sample code that they provide in the documentation!

## Task 1 - Express with DB

Generate an express application and get a database a installed and working. If
you don't have any preferences on which database to use, SQLite is well supported
and cross platform.

## Task 2 - Explore

Take some time to explore all the files and research how everything is setup.
You can reference the textbook for more information on express and the templates
that they use.

## Task 3 - Add all your files (25pts)

Add all your files to your repo to show that you have worked through the
required material.

## Task 4 - Flipgrid (15pts)

Most of this lab was just configuring everything, so the majority of your grade
will be you showing off everything working in a video. Once you have everything
ready create a video using flipgrid!

- [How to record your screen](https://help.flip.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045940833-Screen-Recording-How-to-record-your-screen-using-the-Flipgrid-camera)
- [Flipgrid topic]({{site.data.semester-info.flip[page.slug]}})

You need to demo the following:

- Show your completed express application with database support
- Talk about how the application is structured

## Task 5 - Complete the Retrospective (10pts)

Once you have completed all the tasks open the file **Retrospective.md** and
complete each section with a TODO comment.
