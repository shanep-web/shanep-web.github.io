## Overview

In this lab you will construct a Typescript project template that your company
can use for **front end** development. You will need to figure out how to layout
your Typescript project, compile the Typescript, test the Typescript, and run
your **compiled** code in a browser all without using frameworks. Most of the
tutorials or "guides" on the interwebs just show you how to use Typescript
inside an existing framework, you need to build something from scratch.

The truly hard part of this lab will be shifting through all the cruft and
bad/wrong advice on the interwebs!

## Task 1 - Construct your template

Construct your **hello world** typescript template that does the following:

- Compiles your Project
- Runs unit tests - for this you can use an existing unit test framework like
  qunit, jest, etc.
- Prepares your project to run in a browser. You can use the same live server
  setup that you have been using all semester.
- Write a small hello world application that demonstrates everything working
- You can't use a framework like webpack!

### Examples

There are some good examples that you can look at to get you started. There are
thousands of them out there so be careful about what you select to help guide
you. Both examples below are for backend projects. Your project template will
need to be for the frontend, meaning it will run in the browser.

- [Typescript Hello World](https://github.com/shanep/typescript-hello)
- [Typescript github action](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action)
- [Node Typescript Boilerplate](https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-typescript-boilerplate)

## Deliverables

At the end of this lab you should have completed your starter project template
and made some progress on your tutorial.
