## Overview

In this lesson, we will introduce the JavaScript programming language. 

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Identify the differences between JavaScript and and more traditional Object Oriented language like Java or C#
- Explore how to use Javascript in an asynchronous manner
- Construct simple JavaScript programs that will run in the browser

## Why This Module Is Important

JavaScript is one of the most [popular programming
languages](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)
in the world. JavaScript is supported by every major web browser and makes web applications like
Gmail and Google Maps possible.  Much to some engineers chagrin JavaScript is also popular outside
the web browser for creating server-side web applications (Ex: Node.js, which runs JavaScript).
While JavaScript is a fairly easy language to pick up if you already know another language such as
Java or C# there are enough gotchas to warrant reviewing the language in depth. 

Pay close attention to some of the differences such as the difference between == and === as it can really trip up new JavaScript developers.

Important topics that this module covers:

- Syntax and variables
- Conditionals
- Functions
- Scope and the global object
- Arrays and Maps
- Objects 
- Classes (ES6)
- Closures
- Asynchronous JavaScript
