## Overview

In this lesson we are going to review the project layout that we will be using for the first half of the semester. This
project is all set up to make it easy to write and debug HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this lab your only objective is to go
through each task and make sure your system is all set up to start doing web development!

## Task 0 - Install dev tools

For most of this class we will be developing websites without the use of frameworks. This allows you to truly understand what
is going on under the hood instead of just relying on code that someone else has written. There are a few tools that we will
leverage to help us write better code. You will need to install these tools before you start developing. You can install
these tools using the command line.

```bash
npm install
```

## Task 1 - Run the site

We will use a really handy VSCode plugin to run our site. Install the [Live
Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) built in web server. There are several
cool features of the development server that will make your life easier when authoring web pages. The development server will
reload your browser window when it detects changes! This means you can stay in your editor, make changes to your HTML, CSS,
or javascript files and those changes will automatically be reflected in the browser!

Let's test this out by modifying **index.html** to the following:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Hello World!</title>
  <meta name="description" content="">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-2.19.1.css">
</head>

<body>
  <h1>HTML Rocks!</h1>
  <img src="img/compile.jpeg">
  <script type="module" src="js/main.js"></script>
  <!--
  <div id="qunit"></div>
  <div id="qunit-fixture"></div>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-2.19.1.js"></script>
  <script src="js/test.js"></script>
  -->
  
</body>

</html>
```

Assuming everything is working correctly you should see your webpage update without having to hit the refresh button ðŸ˜Š!

## Task 2 - Debugging Javascript

We are going to make a few small modifications to the starter code and then make sure we can use the built in debugger for
VSCode! Generally speaking it doesn't make much sense to single step through your HTML or CSS code, but any Javascript code
can be debugged just like any other programming language.

- Step 1: Run your development server with `Live Preview: Start Server`
- Step 2: Open the file **js/main.js**
- Step 3: Open the built-in [debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
- Step 4: Click on the debug icon in VSCode and then click the big green arrow that says "Debug
  Website" to start a debugging session.
- Step 5: Modify the loaded function as shown below.
- Step 6: Set a breakpoint on the variable foo and refresh.
- Step 7: Step through the code to see the changes

```javascript
/**
 * Example function to test our debugger
 */
function loaded() {
    let foo = 1;
    let bar = 2;
    let foobar = foo + bar;
    console.log("Loaded main.js: foo + bar = " + foobar);
}
```

You can also use the built in Chrome debugger to debug your in Browser Javascript. However, it is much easier to keep
everything in VSCode instead of bouncing back and forth between your text editor and browser.

## Task 3 - Linting

Linting as defined on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) is the process of static code analysis
to help find programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. We will be linting all of our Javascript,
HTML, and CSS code in this class.

### Javascript

Javascript is an interpreted language. This means we don't have to compile it like Java or C#, we write it and then just run
it directly. This means that any errors that we have will be found at runtime. Even though we don't have a compiler to help
us there are still tools available to help us write better code. In this class we will be using
[eslint](https://eslint.org/). You will be required to fix **ALL** eslint errors in any code that you submit. Some errors are
just style errors while others will cause issues at runtime.

### HTML

Modern browsers are incredibly robust and are able to correctly display even the most broken and wrong html. A browser may be
able to render your webpage but that does not mean that you wrote correct code. In this course we will use
[htmlhint](https://htmlhint.com/) to make sure our html is as correct as possible.

**Important** - Just because your webpage renders correctly does not mean your HTML/CSS/Javascript is actually correct.
This is an unfortunate side effect of the long history of browsers "fixing" poorly formatted pages to just display something.
If your code or markup is wrong you will eventually be bitten by a browser update or some other browser/OS combination that
"fixes" your bad code in a way that was not intended.

### CSS

VSCode already has built in [support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/css#_syntax-verification-linting) for css
that is good enough for our purposes so no other tools will be needed.

## Task 4 - Documentation

We will be using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for all of our JavaScript code in this class. You are required to document all
your code just like you were in CS121 and CS221. For the code that we write in this class JSDoc is almost identical to
JavaDoc. Read the short [getting started guide](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html) for all the details in using
JSDoc.

## Task 5 - Running Grading Scripts

For each lab you will be given a set of grading scripts that you should run. These scripts are written in
[QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/intro/#in-the-browser) and must be run in the browser context. All you have to do is uncomment
them and they will run automatically! You can debug your unit tests just like any other Javascript program as shown in Task
2.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title></title>
  <meta name="description" content="">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-2.19.1.css">
</head>

<body>
  <h1>HTML Rocks!</h1>
  <img src="img/compile.jpeg">
  <script type="module" src="js/main.js"></script>

  <div id="qunit"></div>
  <div id="qunit-fixture"></div>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-2.19.1.js"></script>
  <script src="js/test.js"></script>
  
</body>

</html>
```

## Task 6 - Complete the Retrospective

Once you have completed all the tasks open the file **Retrospective.md** and complete each section with a TODO comment.

## Task 7 - Add, Commit, Push your code

Once you are finished you need to make sure that you have pushed all your code to GitHub for grading!
