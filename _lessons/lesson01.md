## Overview

In this course, we will explore how websites work, their structure, and how information is
communicated across the Internet. Web development consists of a lot of different technologies that
were all developed at different times. What makes web development hard is the vast number of
languages, frameworks, and standards that all somehow fit together to create what we think of as the
"Modern Web". Additionally, web development changes very rapidly so what is the new hot thing today
will be considered obsolete in a few years. This class doesn't teach frameworks, this class teaches
the fundamentals that are used to build everything else. If you understand the fundamentals you can
learn any framework that you may need.

## Task 1 - Review and explore

For this task all you need to do is explore the site. Click through all the links and see if you can
find anything that is missing or broken! You can get extra credit for any typo you find on the
course website. Read all the class policies to make sure you are familiar with what is expected of
you during the semester. 

## Task 2 - Textbook

We will be using an online textbook for this class, the textbook has integrated homework that you
will need to complete each week. Sign up for the [textbook]({{site.data.semester-info.textbook}})
so you can get started on the first homework.

## Task 3 - First Lab

Once you are done with that head over to [lesson02]({% link _lessons/lesson02.md %}) and get started
on the scavenger hunt!
