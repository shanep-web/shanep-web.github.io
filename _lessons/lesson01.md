## Overview



In this course, we will explore how websites work, their structure, and how information is
communicated across the Internet. Web development consists of a lot of different technologies that
were all developed at different times. What makes web development hard is the vast number of
languages, frameworks, and standards that all somehow fit together to create what we think of as the
"Modern Web". Additionally, web development changes very rapidly so what is the new hot thing today
will be considered obsolete in a few years. This class doesn't teach frameworks, this class teaches
the fundamentals that are used to build everything else. If you understand the fundamentals you can
learn any framework that you may need.
