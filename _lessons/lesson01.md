## Overview

{% include youtube.html param="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eKt21AEnlBE" %}

In this course, we will explore how websites work, their structure, and how information is
communicated across the Internet. Web development consists of a lot of different technologies that
were all developed at different times. What makes web development hard is the vast number of
languages, frameworks, and standards that all somehow fit together to create what we think of as the
"Modern Web". Additionally, web development changes very rapidly so what is the new hot thing today
will be considered obsolete in a few years. This class doesn't teach frameworks, this class teaches
the fundamentals that are used to build everything else. If you understand the fundamentals you can
learn any framework that you may need.

project](https://arts.mit.edu/reverberations-spiders-and-musical-webs/)!

## Task 1 - Review and explore

For this task all you need to do is read the [syllabus]({% link _docs/syllabus.md %}) and 
explore the site. Click through all the links and see if you can find anything that is missing
or broken! You can get extra credit for any typo you find on the course website.

## Task 2 - Install Git

You will also need to install git so it is available on the command line if necessary. Git can be
download from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/). If you are on windows make sure and install the
**64-bit Git for Windows Setup** version. Keep all the setting default unless you **really** know
what your doing.

## Task 3 - Install VSCode

While you are free to use whatever IDE or editor you want the only supported editor is VSCode. You
will need to install the [coding pack for
Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/educators/installers) which will give you all the tools
necessary to complete the labs.

## Task 4 - Install Node.js

We will be using Node.js throughout the semester to run our [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) tests and
later in the semester to generate actual websites! So download and install
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from the official website so you can get started writing
some code!

## Task 4 - Post an Introduction
