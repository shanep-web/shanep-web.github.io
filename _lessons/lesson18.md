## Overview

In the previous two labs you learned about Typescript, created a simple tutorial,
and created a project starter template. In this lab you will bing everything
together, put some final polish on your work and create a video demonstrating
your work.

## Task 1

Update your tutorial that you created in the first lab with some CSS flair! Make
sure everything publishes to GitHub correctly and make sure all your examples
work and are camera ready.

## Task 2

You will need to create a 3-5 minute tutorial using flipgrid showing off all
the work that you did!

## Task 3

Watch and comment (video or text) on at least 5 of your classmates submissions
and give positive constructive feedback. How well do you think they explained
the material? Was there any key issues they were missing?
