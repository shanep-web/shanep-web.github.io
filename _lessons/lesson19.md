## Overview 

Most websites and web applications require the development of client-side technologies that interact
with server-side technologies. Client-side (or front-end) refers to those technologies that run in
the web browser like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Server-side (or back-end) refers to those
technologies that run on the web server like AWS Lambda. There are certain things that you should
never do on the client side. For example, directly accessing a database (while possible) should
never be done from the web browser (client side).
