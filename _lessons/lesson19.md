## Overview 

Most websites and web applications require the development of client-side technologies that interact
with server-side technologies. Client-side (or front-end) refers to those technologies that run in
the web browser like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Server-side (or back-end) refers to those
technologies that run on the web server. There are certain things that you should never do on the
client side such as directly accessing a database that is exposed to the web.   In this lesson, we
will create our Heroku accounts and ensure we can access everything that is needed!
