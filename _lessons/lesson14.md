## Overview

Over the next 3 labs you will be studying Javascript and TypeScript
concurrently. For the next three labs I want you pretend that you are the senior
engineer at a successful software company that has decided to transition all
their Javascript code to Typescript. You have been tasked with studying
Typescript and then creating a tutorial the junior engineers can learn from. At
the end of the third lab you will have created a typescript tutorial that will
be hosted on GitHub using a GitHub project page.

The reason you have to create your own tutorial is because the company you work
for doesn't allow any frameworks to be used in their code base. So you will need
to create a tutorial to show your junior engineers how to use Typescript in a
project without frameworks!

## Task 1 - Reading

As the senior engineer your first task is to wrap your head around Typescript.
So read through the following resources to get started. What is listed below
would be the bare minimum. If you want to dive in deeper you may want to read or
skim the handbook if you have time.

- [TypeScript in 5 Minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
- [Typescript Basics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html)
- [Migrating from JavaScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/migrating-from-javascript.html)
- [JS Projects Utilizing Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html)
- [Typescript Handbook (optional)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- [TypeScript for Java/C# Programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-oop.html)

## Task 2

You will need to create a **github project page** to host your tutorial. The
Github [pages site](https://pages.github.com/) will walk you through the
process. The image below shows you what setting to select!

You are not allowed to use a pre-made theme! You will be making your own theme!

## Task 3

You need to complete your own version of [Typescript for JavaScript
Programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).
You are free to emphasize what you feel is important regarding Typescript in
relation to the reading you did in zyBooks. If this were a traditional report
written in Microsoft word you would be shooting for 2 - 3 pages of content.
Content includes code samples, images, diagrams, etc. not just words. The idea
being that a Junior engineer could sit down and read your document in 5 - 10
minutes.

**Important:** This is not intended to be a tutorial that explores the entire
language. This is a quickstart document that should be brief and give the reader
and idea on where to go next!

## Deliverables

A rough outline of what you will have in your tutorial published on GitHub
Pages. You will be working on this during the next two labs so it doesn't have
to be complete. All you have to have done this week is your GitHub page
generating and a rough outline of what you plan on doing.
