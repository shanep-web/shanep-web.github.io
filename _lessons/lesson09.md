## Why This Module Is Important

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a textual language for describing how a web page is styled for
visual presentation. Before CSS was invented it was common for web developers to use the `<table>`
tag to layout websites. CSS is now the de facto standard for adding style to your pages. Check out

the power that modern CSS has!
