## Overview

In this lesson, we will investigate website structure and introduce basic HTML elements. 

## Why This Lesson Is Important

Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a fundamental building block of the web. When HTML was first
invented it was very simple. However, the modern web has added a lot of complexity to the standard.
For example, the current HTML living standard pdf is (as of 2021) 1298 pages long! Compare that to
the current (as of 2021) C++ standard pdf at 1448 pages long. C++ is a turning complete programming
language and HTML is only a markup language. Even if you have extensive experience in HTML take some
time to dive deep into the standard because there is always something you can learn :)
