## Overview

In this lesson we will define what your final project will look like.


## Task 1 - Select your project

You have two options for your final project. You can work on a predefined project or submit your
own idea for a project.

- [Option 1]({% link _docs/simple-blog.md %}) - Simple Blogging Engine
- [Option 2]({% link _docs/project-proposal.md %}) - Define your own project

For both options you will need flush out each section with enough detail to construct your site. 
The examples given to you are not complete! 

### Project Ideas

Can't think of anything to build? Check out the [google graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/) has
(at the time of this writing) 205 killed projects. Keep in mind that google thinks in billions;
billions of users, billions of dollars, and billions of servers! So a lot of these projects were
killed not because they were bad ideas or not successful, they were just not in the billions.

## Task 1 - Schedule office hour visits

You are required to have two zoom meetings with your instructor during the course of the project. We
will review the progress that you have made and answer any questions. These meetings are part of
your grade and are **not optional**. Schedule your meeting
[here]({{site.data.semester-info.office-hours}}). If none of the available time slots fit your
schedule you need to email your instructor to work out an alternative time.
