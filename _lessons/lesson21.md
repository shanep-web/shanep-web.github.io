## Overview

You are going to write a simple blogging engine. Your blog will need to support the following
features:

- A home page that will display all the current blog entries
- A page that allows a user to create a new blog entry
- A page that allows a user to edit an existing blog entry
- A page method to delete blog posts
- You will need 4 separate pages (Home, new, edit, delete)
- Store your blog entries in a database
- (optional) Implement authentication

## Navigation

Each page will have consistent navigation. It will have a be vertical navigation bar similar to how
the course webpage is setup. This should make it easy for the user to know where they are. 

## Style

We are going to write our own style sheet that will have at least 10 CSS rules to make our site
look fancy!  

## Persistence

We will leverage the free Heroku Postgres Starter Tier dev database for our app.

## Frameworks

This project will not use any front end frameworks, everything will be built from scratch.
