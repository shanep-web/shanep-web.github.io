## Overview

You have two options for your final project. You can work on a predefined project or submit your
own idea for a project.

- [Option 1]({% link _docs/simple-blog.md %})
- [Option 2]({% link _docs/project-proposal.md %})

For both options you will need to define your own checkpoints to make sure you keep on track with
getting everything done.

## Project Ideas

Can't think of anything to build? Check out the [google graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/) has
(at the time of this writing) 205 killed projects. Keep in mind that google thinks in billions;
billions of users, billions of dollars, and billions of servers! So a lot of these projects were
killed not because they were bad ideas or not successful, they were just not in the billions.
