## Overview

In this lesson we will define what your final project will look like.


## Task 1 - Select your project

You have two options for your final project. You can work on a predefined project or submit your
own idea for a project.

- [Option 1]({% link _docs/simple-blog.md %}) - Simple Blogging Engine
- [Option 2]({% link _docs/project-proposal.md %}) - Define your own project

For both options you will need flush out each section with enough detail to construct your site. 
The examples given to you are not complete! 

### Project Ideas

Can't think of anything to build? Check out the [google graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/) has
(at the time of this writing) 205 killed projects. Keep in mind that google thinks in billions;
billions of users, billions of dollars, and billions of servers! So a lot of these projects were
killed not because they were bad ideas or not successful, they were just not in the billions.
