## Overview

Most websites and web applications require the development of both client-side
and server-side technologies. Client-side (or front-end) refers to those
technologies that run in the web browser like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Server-side (or back-end) refers to those technologies that run on a server.
For your final project we will create our own custom blogging engine.

You are going to write a simple blogging engine. Your blog will need to support
the following features:

- A home page that will display all the current blog entries
- A page that allows a user to create a new blog entry
- A page that allows a user to edit an existing blog entry
- A page method to delete blog posts
- You will need 4 separate pages (Home, new, edit, delete)
- Store your blog entries in a database
- (optional) Implement authentication

## Navigation

Each page will have consistent navigation. It will have a be vertical navigation
bar similar to how the course webpage is setup. This should make it easy for the
user to know where they are.

## Style

We are going to write our own style sheet that will have at least 10 CSS rules
to make our site look fancy!  

## Persistence

You will need to leverage a database to store your entries

## Frameworks

This project will not use any front end frameworks, everything will be built
from scratch.
