## Overview

Most websites and web applications require the development of both client-side
and server-side technologies. Client-side (or front-end) refers to those
technologies that run in the web browser like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Server-side (or back-end) refers to those technologies that run on a server.
For your final project we will create our own custom blogging engine.

You are going to write a simple blogging engine. Your blog will need to support
the following features:

- Display all the current blog entries
- Create a new blog entry
- Edit an existing blog entry
- Delete blog posts
- Store your blog entries in a database
- (optional) Implement authentication

## Navigation

If you have multiple pages each page will have consistent navigation. If it is
a single page app then make sure that you have a clear and easy way to navigate
your page.

## Style

We are going to write our own style sheet that will have at least 10 CSS rules
to make our site look fancy!  

## Persistence

You will need to leverage a database to store your entries.

## Frameworks

This project will not use any front end frameworks, everything will be built
from scratch.
