## Overview

In this lesson, we will introduce server-side programming.

## Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Identify when a server-side language such as NodeJS is useful in web development.
- Use NodeJS templates reduce repetitive HTML and produce dynamic content based on conditionals.
- Explore functions available in NodeJS and use them to implement server-side logic.

## Why This lesson Is Important

Most websites and web applications require the development of client-side technologies that interact
with server-side technologies. Client-side (or front-end) refers to those technologies that run in
the web browser like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Server-side (or back-end) refers to those
technologies that run on the web server like NodeJS. There are certain things that you should never
do on the client side. For example, accessing a database (while possible) should never be done from
the web browser. 

Important topics that this module covers:

- Full stack development 
- Nodejs fundamentals (conditionals, loops, arrays, etc.)
- Common functions such as date/time and math
- Cookies and sessions
