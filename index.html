<p>
    Welcome to the class! My name is Shane Panter and I will be your instructor for this course. For many students, this will be the first time you have been exposed to web development  topics. This course has been designed to take someone who has never seen these concepts before to being able to produce relatively complex programs in 16 weeks. This class is a three credit course and it is specifically designed to require 8 to 10 hours of work each week. In order to succeed in the course, it will be critical for you to manage your time effectively and keep up with the reading and lab activities.  Please take some time to get familiar with the course website. Pay close attention to when the homework assignments are due to ensure you get everything in on time. <br><br> We will be interacting with each other primarily through Github, discussion forums, and videos. Get started by completing the Course Introduction homework below!

      </h2>
    

<p>
    

    Final grades will be assigned with the formula [Earned Points]/[Total Points].
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you earn 760 points out of 1000 points offered your
    grade would be a 76%. So your final
    letter grade will be a C according to the chart below. <strong>Grades will not be
    rounded</strong>, if you are on a grade boundary please see the <a
    href="#extra-credit-opportunities">extra credit</a> section below for opportunities to improve
    your grade.

<p>
    The passing grade for courses in the Computer Science Department is 70%. So we can calculate the
    absolute minimum number of points that you need to earn in this course as 701. To know if you still can pass the course all you need
    to do is take your current grade and then add in any points that you could still earn before the
    end of the semester. If that number is below 701 then it is not mathematically possible for you to pass the class.

<p>
    Instructors can enter a grade of Iâ€”for incompleteâ€”if both of the following conditions are present:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You have completed either 80% of the course or 80% of the coursework.
    </li>
    <li>
        Extenuating circumstances make it impossible for you to complete the course before the end of the semester.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Be aware that the University considers an extenuating circumstance to be along the lines of "I
    was in the hospital for the last 2 weeks in a coma". More information can be found on the
    <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/degree-requirements/grades/">registrar's</a> page.

          Academic Honesty Policy <a href="#academic-honesty">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>
    Programming assignments require the implementation of working programs using the language
    constructs and techniques introduced in class. Programs must execute and compile on the operating
    system and compiler specified.  Students are expected to work on their own unless explicitly
    instructed otherwise.  Students who allow their work to be copied will be written up along with
    the student who copied. Cheating is grounds for immediate failure of the course. This includes
    trying to find answers to problems, programs, exams or providing (directly or indirectly)
    your completed assignments to other students. Uploading solutions to sites such as 
    <a href="https://chegg.com">cheeg.com</a> is also considered an academic honesty violation and
    will be reported to the dean of students.
</p>

<p>
    Boise State promotes Academic Excellence as a core Shared Value upholding the virtue of honesty in
    the pursuit of knowledge. Behaving with integrity and honesty is a hallmark of a Boise State
    University graduate. The conferring of a degree represents the University's indication that the
    recipient has engaged in academic work that is representative of her/his own efforts and that was
    completed with integrity and honesty.
</p>
<p>
    Upholding academic integrity in all assignments provides students with the opportunity to engage
    with the material being investigated and assert their evidence based findings. This behavior
    demonstrates the commitment to learning and preparation necessary for a successful future. All
    work you submit must represent your own ideas and effort or be cited including any material you
    wrote for another course; when work does not, it is academic dishonesty. <strong>Academic
    dishonesty in any form may result in failure in the course or dismissal from the Program and/or
    the University.</strong>

          Late Work Policy <a href="#late-work-policy">#</a>
        
        
      </h2>
    

<p>
    All assignments can be submitted up to <strong>3 days late without penalty</strong>, after 3 days
    past the due date absolutely no work will be accepted under any circumstances.  No work will be
    accepted after the <strong>last day of course instruction</strong>, the semester has to end at
    some point so plan accordingly.  Work submitted 1 second late is treated the same as work
    submitted 1 day late. You can find the last day of course instruction at
    the <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/boise-state-academic-calendars/">registrar</a>.
    Plenty of extra credit is offered to offset any missed assignment(s).

<p>
    BroncoMail is the official communication channel through which all university business is
    conducted. It is expected that you access and read university communications two or three
    times per week. For more information see the University Policy on Student Email
    Communications <a
    href="https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/policy-title-student-e-mail-communications/">(Policy

    accounts such as Gmail or Yahoo.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Your instructor will make every effort to return emails within 48hrs Monday thru Friday between
    the hours of 9:00am and 5:00pm (MST). Emails sent on Saturday, Sunday, or outside of the defined
    hours will be returned within 48hrs on the following business day. Emails should be reserved for
    questions that are not appropriate for a public forum such as grades or other personal issues. If
    you don't receive a response from your instructor after 48hrs please check to make sure you are
    sending the email from BroncoMail and send a follow-up email.

<p>
    We will be using an online discussion board for this course. Rather than emailing questions to me, please post your
    questions on the discussion board and get replies from myself as well as your classmates! You can also post private
    messages to me. You are expected to log onto the board at least once a week and read all the posts.

<p>
    There is no grade associated with attending class. However, if the behavior of a student impacts
    other students ability to learn there could be an impact to your final grade. It is the student's
    responsibility to make up any work missed during class within the prescribed late work policy
    window. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Don't come into class sick!</strong> There is no reason to come to class sick under any
    circumstances. Most of the material is available online either in video or text format so you
    can easily catch up on anything that you may have missed in class!
